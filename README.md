# ClimateWins: Machine Learning with Python

## Project Overview
ClimateWins is an European nonprofit organization focused on identifying the causes and consequences of climate change across Europe. As climate patterns become increasingly unpredictable, ClimateWins seeks data-driven insights to support informed decision-making and improve preparedness for extreme weather events.

This project applies machine learning techniques in Python to historical climate data in order to analyze patterns, identify predictors of extreme weather, and evaluate the effectiveness of various supervised learning models.

## Project Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze historical climate data across Europe
- Identify patterns and relationships between climate variables
- Predict weather-related outcomes using supervised machine learning models
- Compare model performance and optimization techniques
- Translate analytical findings into actionable insights for stakeholders

## Key Questions
- What climate variables are most influential in predicting extreme weather?
- How do different supervised learning algorithms perform on climate data?
- Can optimization and scaling techniques improve model accuracy?
- What are the limitations of machine learning in climate analysis?

## Data Sources & Description
The datasets used in this project contain historical climate observations across Europe, including:

- Temperature
